# Technical Documentation

## Project Structure

- `app.R`: Main Shiny application file containing both UI and server logic
- `data_generation.R`: Functions for generating synthetic supply chain data
- `data_analysis.R`: Functions for analyzing supply chain data, including metrics calculation, trend analysis, forecasting, and disruption identification
- `custom.css`: Custom CSS styles for the dashboard
- `tests.R`: Unit tests for data generation and analysis functions
- `app_test.R`: Integration tests for the Shiny application

## Key Components

### Data Generation

The `generate_supply_chain_data()` function in `data_generation.R` creates synthetic supply chain data with the following features:
- Daily order volumes with weekly seasonality and trend
- Holiday effects (e.g., increased orders around Christmas)
- Inventory levels with random fluctuations
- Lead times with occasional disruptions
- Supplier performance scores

### Data Analysis

The `data_analysis.R` file contains several functions for analyzing supply chain data:

1. `calculate_metrics()`: Computes key supply chain metrics such as average order volume, lead time, supplier performance, inventory turnover, order fulfillment rate, perfect order rate, and cash-to-cash cycle.

2. `perform_trend_analysis()`: Calculates moving averages and rate of change for order volumes, identifies overall trends, volatility, and peak/trough days.

3. `forecast_demand()`: Uses the `auto.arima()` function from the `forecast` package to generate demand forecasts and calculate accuracy metrics.

4. `identify_disruptions()`: Detects potential supply chain disruptions based on lead time and supplier performance z-scores.

### Shiny Application

The main `app.R` file is structured as follows:

1. UI Definition: Uses `shinydashboard` to create a responsive layout with multiple tabs.

2. Server Logic:
   - Handles data loading (generated or uploaded)
   - Implements reactive expressions for data processing and analysis
   - Creates interactive visualizations using `plotly`
   - Manages user interactions and updates

3. Performance Optimizations:
   - Memoization of expensive functions using `memoise`
   - Data downsampling for large datasets
   - Caching using `cachem`

4. Error Handling:
   - Input validation
   - Error messages using `shinyalert`
   - Safe wrappers for potentially error-prone functions

## Testing

1. Unit Tests (`tests.R`):
   - Verify the correctness of data generation and analysis functions
   - Ensure proper output formats and expected behaviors

2. Integration Tests (`app_test.R`):
   - Test the Shiny application's functionality using `shinytest`
   - Verify correct behavior for file uploads, date range selection, and tab switching

## Deployment

To deploy this application:

1. Ensure all required packages are installed on the deployment server.
2. Copy all project files to the server.
3. Configure the server to run the Shiny application (e.g., using Shiny Server or RStudio Connect).
4. Set up appropriate security measures, especially if allowing file uploads.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication and role-based access control
- Add more advanced forecasting models and allow users to choose between different models
- Integrate with real-time data sources for live supply chain monitoring
- Implement automated alerts for detected disruptions or anomalies
- Enhance visualization options with more customizable charts and graphs
